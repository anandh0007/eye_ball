  Project Description:

  The overall program creates a visual representation of a face with two eyes and a mouth. The eyes follow the mouse movement, providing an interactive and dynamic effect. The colors, sizes, and positions of the   elements are defined through CSS, and the interaction is handled through JavaScript. This example showcases a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and interactive graphical element.
